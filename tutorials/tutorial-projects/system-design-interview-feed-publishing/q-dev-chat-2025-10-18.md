Creating a Draw.io diagram file representing the feed publishing architecture from the provided image

---

I've created a Draw.io diagram file `feed-publishing-architecture.drawio` that represents the feed publishing system architecture from the image. The diagram includes:

- **User components**: DNS, Web browser, Mobile app
- **Load balancer** with API call details
- **Web servers** cluster with Authentication and Rate Limiting
- **Post Service** → Post Cache → Post DB flow
- **Fanout Service** with numbered workflow steps (①-⑤)
- **Message Queue** for async processing
- **Fanout Workers** cluster
- **Databases**: Graph DB, User Cache, User DB, News Feed Cache
- **Notification Service**

You can open this file in Draw.io (diagrams.net) or VS Code with the Draw.io extension to view and edit it.

Creating AWS architecture diagram with 2024 icons for feed publishing system

---

Created an AWS architecture diagram using 2024 AWS icons that maps the feed publishing system to AWS services:

- **Route 53** for DNS
- **Users** icon for client access
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution
- **ECS Fargate** for web servers
- **Lambda** functions for Post Service, Fanout Service, and Workers
- **SNS** for notifications
- **ElastiCache** for caching layers (Post, User, News Feed)
- **RDS** for databases (Post DB, User DB)
- **Neptune** for Graph DB (friend relationships)
- **SQS** for message queuing

The diagram maintains the same flow and numbered steps (①-⑤) as the original architecture while using proper AWS service icons.
