@diagram.drawio.xml generate the gui for this application

---

I'll help you generate the GUI for the application based on the diagram. Let me first examine the diagram file to understand the application structure.

---

Based on the diagram, I can see this is a feedback application with the following components:
- User interacts with a desktop application
- API Gateway endpoint handles requests
- Landing page function (Lambda)
- Record and Confirm feedback function (Lambda)
- Feedback Table (DynamoDB)
- SNS Topic for notifications
- Confirmation Email

Let me check the current workspace structure to understand what's already there:

---

I'll create a simple web-based GUI for this feedback application. Based on the diagram, I'll create:

1. A landing page with a feedback form
2. A confirmation page
3. Basic styling and JavaScript for interaction

---

Creating the main landing page with feedback form

---

Creating the confirmation page that shows after successful feedback submission

---

Creating CSS styles for the feedback application with modern design

---

Creating JavaScript for form handling and API integration

I've created a complete GUI for your feedback application based on the diagram. Here's what I've built:

## Files Created:

1. **index.html** - Main landing page with feedback form
2. **confirmation.html** - Success page shown after submission
3. **styles.css** - Modern, responsive styling
4. **script.js** - JavaScript for form handling and API integration

## Features:

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Feedback Form**: Includes name, email, category, star rating, and message fields
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner during submission
- **Confirmation Page**: Displays success message and feedback summary
- **Email Confirmation**: Mentions that confirmation email will be sent (matching your SNS/email flow)

## Key Components Matching Your Diagram:

- **Landing Page Function**: The main form interface
- **Record & Confirm Feedback**: Form submission handling
- **User Interface**: Clean, professional design
- **Confirmation Flow**: Success page with summary

## To Use:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the feedback form
2. Fill out and submit the form to see the confirmation page
3. Update the `API_ENDPOINT` in `script.js` with your actual API Gateway URL

The GUI is ready to integrate with your AWS backend (Lambda functions, DynamoDB, SNS) by updating the API endpoint in the JavaScript file.
